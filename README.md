NestJS Practical Challenges Roadmap

🏆 1. CRUD REST API Project

Objective: Build a basic API for Blog / Notes / Todo app.

User registration & authentication (JWT)

CRUD endpoints for posts or tasks

Input validation (class-validator)

Error handling with filters

Integrate PostgreSQL via TypeORM or Prisma

Outcome: Learn Controllers, Services, DTOs, and database integration.

🥇 2. Authentication & Authorization Implementation

Extend previous project:

JWT-based login with refresh tokens

Role-based access control (admin vs user)

Guards for protected routes

Outcome: Guards, Interceptors, and Passport strategies with JWT.

🏅 3. Frontend Integration Challenge

Task: Build a React or Next.js frontend consuming your NestJS API.

Secure API calls with tokens

Handle login/logout flows

Display protected data using token refresh logic

Outcome: Real-world API consumption and CORS setup.

💥 4. Real-time Chat using WebSockets

Task: Build a minimal chat backend.

Users connect to rooms

Broadcast messages to all users in room

Persist chat history in database

Outcome: Gateways and event-based communication in NestJS.

🚀 5. File Uploads & Static Serving Project

Task: API endpoints to:

Upload profile images or documents

Store files on server or cloud (AWS S3 / Firebase)

Serve uploaded files securely

Outcome: Multer integration, Static module usage, cloud storage SDK practice.

📅 6. Scheduled Jobs & Background Tasks

Task: Create endpoints that trigger background tasks.

Scheduled emails

Database cleanup jobs

Outcome: Using @nestjs/schedule, Bull queues for background processing.

🛡️ 7. API Security with Rate Limiting

Task: Protect APIs from abuse.

Rate limiting per user/IP

Global exception filters for throttling errors

Outcome: Throttler module usage and security hardening.

🌟 8. Mini e-Commerce Backend

Task: Full project integrating all skills.

User auth

Product CRUD

Orders & payments (mock or Stripe)

Admin dashboard APIs

Outcome: Complex schema design, payment gateway integration, and production-grade patterns.

🔑 Recommended Sequence:

CRUD REST API with auth

WebSockets chat app

File uploads

Scheduled jobs

Mini e-commerce backend

Use this as your NestJS practical roadmap to strengthen your backend development skills systematically.

Prepared for your focused NestJS learning and project planning.
